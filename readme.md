psql -U postgres -d test -f prepare.sql
pg_restore -U postgres -d test lv_yvent.dump

> Pwd: masrad

## Troubleshooting

Be sure Composer is using the right PHP (at least PHP 7.0)

In Windows, if you get PDO exception on attempt to login, you're probably not using postgres driver for PHP.
You should uncomment the line containing `php_pdo_pgsql.dll` in the php.ini file.
To find where is php.ini file you can type `where php` on cmd or `which php` on powershell.
